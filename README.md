In this Repo find the designs and sofrtware needed to implement magnetic voluntary head-fixation as desctibed in 

Rich, P. D., et al., . “Magnetic Voluntary Head-Fixation in Transgenic Rats Enables Lifetime Imaging of Hippocampal Neurons.” bioRxiv, August 21, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.17.553594.

# fixation_hardware
This directory is the pack-and-go CAD directory for the main fixation hardware.
The file to open in inventor is "Assembly2.iam"
files were created in inventor 2019

# software
\bearing_switch
this directory contains the firmeware for the arduino running the bearing detection circuit
electronics\tri_mount_adj_2

this device sences the bearing balls in teh kinematic bearings and sends the appropriate output as BNCs TTL that are routed to the scanimage control system and the behaviural control 

\pc_software
this directory runs the PC code for the flow control of training of cvoluntary head fixation and some behavioural experiments.

it runs in MATLAB
and is started using controllerGUI.m

the sub programs that are loaded via teh GUI are prefaced "pFSM"

pFSM_train_poke.m - is the main program that will train the animal to achieve voluntary head fixation
